# Uses web scraping in order to fix many problems with Wattpad DM's

So the current Wattpad DM Service is pretty much hot garbage. I'll go ahead and line out a few problems now: 
  
  * Messages cannot be sent with the enter key, you have to click the button to send a message
  * You MUST refresh the entire page in order to see new messages you were sent. (WTF)

And it was mainly to fix these two annoying problems that I created this program.
It was also mainly for me to learn web-scraping and Flask, and I like to think I achieved that. 

BUG FIXES TO ADD:
- [ ] (MAIN) Messages you send will be buried in requests, and as such will take too long to actually send
- [ ] Cannot currently select from all available DM's.
